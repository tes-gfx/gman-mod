# GMAN module
GMAN is the Gfx Manager for TES EvalKits and MUST NOT be used in a production
system for safety and security reasons.
It is a virtual DRM module, not backed by any hardware. It can be used to
allocate video memory via GEM for a TES IP cores. Therefore, it returns BO
handles to an user space application that can be used to map the video memory
into its memory space. It is also able to determine the physical address
of a BO and return it to user space.

For the DE10-Nano board, the module will also act as a dummy KMS module and
bring up the ADV7511 as a DRM bridge. A CDC display controller can be used
for display output to ADV7511's DPI-2 interface without any further
configuration.
Note that the ADV7511 bridge driver will check the EDID of a connected display
and check the available modes against a hardcoded frequency value of 65 MHz.
That means either the CDC must be connected to a 65 MHz clock or the driver
code must be modified to match the actual clock frquency.
65 MHz matches the pixel frequency of a 1024x768@60Hz mode.

# Remarks
Handling physical addresses in Linux user space is a bad idea. It makes the
system very vulnerable. Since hardware blocks in an embedded system can usually
access all the system's memory, they can be used to circumvent Linux memory
protection. Furthermore, the system will become vulnerable against simple
user land application bugs.
Use GMAN for evaluation only.
